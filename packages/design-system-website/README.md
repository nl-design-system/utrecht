# Website

The Utrecht Design System website is composed of multiple parts:

- `./` for Docusaurus
- `./storybook/` for Storybook (with the [Storybook Composition](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/storybook-composition) to include framework specific Storybooks)
- `./storybook-vue/` for Vue.js Component Storybook

This package combines the parts so they can be deployed together as one.
