# Table

This Table web component is experimental, please share your experiences with our team.

The web component version of the Table component has not yet been tested for accessibility with various assistive tools. Using the CSS component of Table is recommended for now.

Accessibility has been tested in the following manner:

- Accessibility panel in Chrome Developer tools shows the same role structure as the native HTML table equivalent.

For accessibility of `<table-header-cell>` you MUST set the `scope="col"` or `scope="row"` attribute.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">{Table.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>
