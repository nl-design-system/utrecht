        1234567890 Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What&apos;s up? Well,
        I finished my circle. I don&apos;t pick up any life readings. There isn&apos;t enough life on this ice cube to
        fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I&apos;m going back.

        I&apos;ll get my people to work on it. Good. You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She&apos;s the
        fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
        Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes.

        stuck up...half-witted...scruffy-looking...nerf-herder! Who&apos;s scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty
        close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid? Why, I guess you don&apos;t know everything about
        women yet? Headquarters personnel, report to command center. Take it easy. Excuse us, please. Princess...we have
        a visitor. We&apos;ve picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.

        Hello? How interesting. Oh, my. Who are you? Oh, I&apos;m terribly sorry. I, I didn&apos;t mean to intrude.
