# Documentation site of Utrecht Design System

## Docusaurus

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/) to display a website. The sidebar is generated based on the directory structure of the shared `documentation/website` folder and the top navigation is specified in `docusaurus.config.js`.

## Documentation sourced from shared folder

The documentation is sourced from the root `/documentation/website` directory. To ensure your docs are build run `npm run docs` from the root of the repo. This will also ensure the watcher for the documentation repo is started.
