feat: added mixins for content-appropriate textbox sizes

Added mixins to define textbox sizes that better match the expected content.
For example, a smaller width can be applied to postcode fields to align with the standard Dutch postcode length.
These sizes are not applied automatically; developers need to explicitly use the mixins.
