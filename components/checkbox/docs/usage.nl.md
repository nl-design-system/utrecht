# Usage

Checkboxes are usually used to provide a way for users to make a range of selections (zero, one or more). They can also be used to tell users that they agree to specific terms.

## Containers

Checkboxes can be used in forms on a full page or in modals.

## When to use

Checkboxes are used for multiple choices, not for mutually exclusive choices. Each checkbox works independently from other checkboxes in the list, therefore checking an additional box does not affect any other selections.
