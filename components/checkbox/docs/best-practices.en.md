# Best practices

## Do's

Checkboxes must:

- Work independently of each other: selecting a checkbox may not change the selection status of another checkbox in the list.
- Be positively boxed: for example “Enable notifications” instead of “Disable notifications”.
- Always have a label handy when you use it to turn a setting on or off.
- Use label tags as click targets.
- Be arranged in a logical order, whether alphabetical, numeric, time-based or some other clear system.
- Link to more information or have a subtitle for more explanation. Don't rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox.
- If they are too long, run over the second line. This is preferable than truncation.
- If they are too long, they will be aligned left
- If they are too long, let the text flow under the checkbox so that the control and label are aligned at the top.

## Don'ts

Checkboxes must:

- Not cut with an omit task if the label is too long and run over 2 lines.
