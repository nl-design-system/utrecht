# Backdrop

The backdrop component can be used as background to obscure the content behind modal user interface elements, such as a modal dialog.

## Terminology

"Backdrop" matches the name for the `::backdrop` CSS pseudo-element selector of the HTML element `dialog`.

"Viewport" matches the name of the containing block for [`position: fixed`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position/#valdef-position-fixed) in CSS.
