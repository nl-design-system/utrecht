   * `break-inside`: avoid spreading the URL over two columns.

   * Better to have the entire URL in one column.

   * `hyphens`: since hyphens are often part of a URL, the user cannot know if the hypen
   * is part of the URL and it should be used to visit the page, or if it should be ignored.
   * Better to avoid inserting any hyphens automatically.

   * `overflow-wrap`: "To prevent overflow, an otherwise unbreakable string of
   * characters — like a long word or URL — may be broken at any point if there
   * are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line."

   * Without `overflow-wrap`, some long URLs will not fit on a printed page.

   * `page-break-inside`: The user might not realise an URL is incomplete,
   * and continues on the next printed page.
   *
   * TODO: Perhaps `hyphens: none` can be removed, because `overflow-wrap: anywhere`
   * has that effect already.
