# URL with mixed left-to-right path

When displaying an URL in HTML, explicitly mark the text directionality as left-to-right using `dir="ltr"`, to prevent trailing non-word characters such as `/` to be misplaced in a right-to-left document. A trailing slash might end up before `http:` when the URL is in right-to-left text such as Arabic. To maintain the correct rendering even in automated translations of a document, specifically mark URLs as `dir="ltr"` even when the document as a whole is already configured as such using `<html dir="ltr">`.
