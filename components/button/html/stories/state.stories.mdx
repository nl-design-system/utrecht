# Button

## States

### Disabled

Button with `disabled` state:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="disabled"
    args={{
      textContent: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog",
      disabled: true,
    }}
  >
    {Button.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled and focusable

Button with `disabled` state that remains focusable.

Since the `disabled` attribute on HTML makes it impossible to focus the element, the `aria-disabled="true"` attribute is used instead. Any script handling the activation of such button must first check wether the button is disabled before executing the script, because without the `disabled` attribute the browser no longer prevents activation. For `type="reset"` and `type="submit"` additional scripting is required too, to prevent default behavior.

Considerations for the focusable disabled button:

- must display a focus ring when focused
- must not appear interactive
  - must not change appearance for the active state
  - must not change appearance for the focus state
  - must not change appearance for the hover state

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="disabled and focusable"
    args={{
      textContent: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog",
      disabled: true,
      focusable: true,
    }}
  >
    {Button.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Busy

Button with `aria-busy` state:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="busy"
    args={{
      busy: true,
      textContent: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog",
    }}
    parameters={{
      // `cursor` cannot be tested using visual regression testing, ignore this story
      chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
    }}
  >
    {Button.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Busy and disabled

Button that is both busy and disabled. The busy cursor should have precedence over the disabled cursor.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="busy and disabled"
    args={{
      busy: true,
      disabled: true,
      textContent: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog",
    }}
    parameters={{
      // `cursor` cannot be tested using visual regression testing, ignore this story
      chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
    }}
  >
    {Button.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Types

### Submit

Button with `submit` type:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="submit"
    args={{
      textContent: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog",
      type: "submit",
    }}
    parameters={{
      // `cursor` cannot be tested using visual regression testing, ignore this story
      chromatic: { disableSnapshot: true },
    }}
  >
    {Button.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
